									<h1>Introduction</h1>
									<p>Uber, one of the largest taxi services globally, operates in a highly competitive market where
										pricing is a critical factor for its users. A major challenge faced by Uber is its dynamic pricing
										model, which often leaves customers confused about fare fluctuations. This unpredictability makes
										it difficult for users to plan their travels cost-effectively.</p>
									<p>Understanding and predicting Uber fares
										based on variables such as time, day, and location can empower users to make more informed
										booking decisions. Additionally, while Uber offers a fare reservation feature, it is underutilized
										due to users' lack of confidence in whether the reserved fare aligns with potential future price
										changes.</p>

									<h3>Strategic Objectives</h3>
									<p>This project seeks to bridge the gap between user expectations and Uber's pricing strategy,
										ultimately delivering actionable insights for both users and the company.	</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>What are the primary factors influencing Uber fare prices?</strong></li>
										<li><strong>How do fare prices vary based on time of day, day of the week, and geographical location?</strong></li>
										<li><strong>What is the optimal time frame for users to book rides to secure the best rates?</strong></li>
										
									</ul>
									
									<p>Research in Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies highlights the influence of
										temporal and spatial factors, such as traffic and demand density, on surge pricing. These findings serve as a basis for our exploration of Uber’s fare patterns1. Similarly, a Harvard Business Review
										case study on Uber’s surge pricing underscores the importance of balancing revenue optimization
										and customer loyalty, emphasizing transparency in fare models2.</p>
									<p>Studies from The Journal of Business Research demonstrate how machine learning optimizes
										pricing strategies using historical and behavioral data, which aligns with our objective to predict
										Uber fares accurately3. Additionally, tools like “RideGuru” provide fare estimates but lack the
										depth needed to account for dynamic price changes, a gap our project seeks to address4.</p>
									<p>Building on these studies and discussions, we aim to analyze Uber fare patterns using a
										combination of temporal, spatial, and behavioral factors. Our predictive model will enhance user
										understanding of fare trends and provide data-driven insights into optimal booking times.</p>

									<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
									<h2>Data Preparation</h2>
									<h4>The data for this analysis is sourced from the TSA Claims Database, available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/uber-fares-dataset">Uber Fares Dataset</a>.</h4>
									<p>The dataset used in this project focuses on transactional data from Uber, the world's largest taxi
										service. The dataset contains trip-level information, including geographical coordinates, time
										stamps, and passenger details, enabling comprehensive analysis of fare determinants. The dataset
										was obtained from Kaggle repository5 and includes essential trip details.</p>
									<p>The table below summarizes the features in the dataset:</p>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/uber-1.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
									<p>This dataset contains 200,000 records spanning trips from 2009 to 2015, providing a
										comprehensive view of Uber's fare patterns over time. It will be used to train and validate
										predictive models for estimating Uber fares based on trip characteristics. The temporal coverage
										allows us to analyze trends and variations in pricing influenced by factors such as distance,
										passenger count, and time of day.</p>

									<h2>Data Feature Engineering</h2>
									<P>To capture the temporal factors influencing Uber fares, the pickup_datetime column was
										transformed to extract key features such as the hour of the day, day of the week, and month. These
										features enable a detailed analysis of fare variations during different times of the day, across
										weekdays and weekends, and between months, helping identify peak and off-peak trends.</P>
									<p>To understand the relationship between trip distance and fare amounts, the Haversine formula was
										used to calculate the shortest distance between pickup and dropoff locations. This formula, which
										computes distances over the Earth's surface, is essential for deriving an accurate distance feature based on latitude and longitude data. The calculated distance serves as a crucial predictor of fare
										amounts.</p>
									<p>The Haversine formula is given by:</p>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/uber-12.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
									<p>where:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>ϕ1,ϕ2: Latitude of the pickup and dropoff points in radians.</li>
										<li>Δϕ,Δλ: Differences in latitude and longitude between pickup and dropoff points.</li>
										<li>r: Radius of Earth (~6371 km).</li>

									<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
									<h3>1. Handling Missing Values</h3>
									<p>The dataset was initially examined for missing values. Fortunately, one missing values
										were identified and removed.</p>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/uber-2.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>

									<h3>2. Removal of Partial 2015 Data</h3>
									<p>While the dataset spans from 2009 to 2015, the data for 2015 was incomplete. To ensure
										consistent monthly analysis, all 2015 records were removed, resulting in a cleaner and
										more reliable dataset for analysis.</p>
										<img class="img-responsive" src="images/uber-3.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>

									<h3>3. Filtering Invalid Passenger Counts</h3>
									<p>The dataset included a passenger_count variable, which sometimes had invalid values such
										as 0 or excessively high values of 50 or more. These entries were deemed unrealistic and
										excluded from the dataset to maintain data integrity.</p>
										<img class="img-responsive" src="images/uber-4.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>

									<h3>4. Filtering Invalid Latitude and Longitude</h3>
									<p>The dataset included pickup and dropoff latitude and longitude coordinates for each trip.
										However, some coordinates were incorrectly recorded (e.g., values outside of valid latitude
										and longitude ranges). These erroneous records were identified and removed.</p>
										<div class="desc">

									<h1>Methods</h1>
									<h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
									<p>The exploratory analysis focuses on understanding key patterns in the Uber dataset related to trip
										distance, fare prices, temporal factors, and passenger behavior. By visualizing data distributions
										and relationships, we can uncover insights into factors affecting Uber fares. These findings will
										guide further feature engineering and predictive modeling.</p>
									<p>The figure below highlights the distribution of trips and average fares based on distance ranges.
										Most trips are short distances (2–5 km), while longer trips above 30 km are rare but correspond to
										significantly higher fares due to extended distances. This trend reflects a proportional relationship
										between distance and fare prices.</p>
										<div class="desc">
											<img class="img-responsive" src="images/uber-14.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
											<h5>Figure 3.1 Distribution of trip counts and fares by distance range</h5>
										</div>
									<p>Hourly analysis shows that trip counts peak during evening rush hours (6–8 PM), reflecting high
										demand. Conversely, average fares tend to be higher in the early morning and late-afternoon hours,
										potentially due to fewer available drivers and longer average trip distances during these times.</p>
										<div class="desc">
											<img class="img-responsive" src="images/uber-15.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
											<h5>Figure 3.2 Hourly trends in trip counts and fares</h5>
										</div>
									<p>Most trips involve a single passenger, indicating that Uber's services cater primarily to individual
										users. Average fares show a moderate increase with more passengers, likely reflecting the longer
										distances or larger vehicle requirements for group travel.</p>
										<div class="desc">
											<img class="img-responsive" src="images/uber-16.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
											<h5>Figure 3.3 Passenger count distribution and fare patterns</h5>
										</div>
									<p>Trip counts remain consistent throughout the year, with February showing a slight dip due to fewer
										days. Seasonal trends are observed in fares, with higher fares during the summer months,
										potentially due to increased tourism or travel demand.</p>
										<div class="desc">
											<img class="img-responsive" src="images/uber-17.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
											<h5>Figure 3.4 Monthly trends in trip counts and fares</h5>
										</div>
									<p>The analysis reveals higher trip volumes on weekdays, particularly Fridays, indicating regular
										commute patterns and work-related travel. Average fares remain steady throughout the week but
										show a slight increase at weekends, possibly reflecting higher leisure travel demand.</p>

									<h2>Modeling</h2>
									<h3>Regression Analysis on Fare Amount</h3>
									<p>The regression model achieved an R² of 0.73, explaining 73% of the variance in fare amounts.
										These results demonstrate a reasonably good fit, with room for improvement in capturing fare
										variability.</p>
										<div class="desc">
											<img class="img-responsive" src="images/uber-20.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
											<h5>Figure 4.1 Feature importance from regression analysis</h5>
										</div>
									<p>The most significant factor affecting fare prediction is the trip distance. For each additional
										kilometer traveled, the fare increases by 2.32 units. This highlights the direct and proportional
										relationship between distance and fare, making it the primary determinant in the pricing model.
										Temporal factors like the time of day strongly influence fares. Peak hours such as 2 PM, 12 PM,
										and 3 PM contribute to fare increases of 1.39, 1.32, and 1.28 units, respectively. </p>
									<p>These time slots
										reflect higher demand, leading to increased pricing. Seasonal and weekly patterns play a notable
										role in fare variability. For instance, trips in September add 0.68 units to the fare, likely due to
										seasonal demand. Similarly, Thursdays added 0.41 units, indicating increased travel activity on
										this day of the week. Trips involving larger groups, such as those with six passengers, raise fares
										by 0.71 units. This increase likely reflects the need for larger vehicles or additional services, which
										are more costly.</p>

									<h1>Model Performance Comparison</h1>
									<p>To identify the best-performing model for fare prediction, three models were trained: Decision
										Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The dataset was split into an 80:20 ratio for training and
										testing. Using 10-fold cross-validation ensured robust performance evaluations, while Grid Search
										optimization was applied to tune hyperparameters for each model. The objective was to minimize
										Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and maximize R², ensuring accurate and reliable prediction.</p>
										<div class="desc">
											<img class="img-responsive" src="images/uber-21.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
											<h5>Figure 4.2 Model performance comparison result</h5>
										</div>
									<p>The Random Forest model emerged as the best-performing model for fare prediction, achieving
										the lowest MAE of $2.20 and the highest R² of 0.747, effectively explaining fare variability. While
										the Decision Tree showed significant improvement after tuning (MAE: 2.30, R²: 0.739), and
										XGBoost performed comparably (MAE: 2.21, R²: 0.742), Random Forest outperformed both by
										capturing complex relationships between features. The baseline regression model (MAE: 2.26, R²:
										0.728) provided a solid starting point but lacked the flexibility of tree-based models, reinforcing
										Random Forest’s robustness as the optimal choice.</p>

						<h1>Conclusion</h1>
						<p>This analysis provides critical insights into factors influencing Uber fare prices and strategies to
										optimize booking. The most significant predictor of fare amounts is distance traveled, followed by
										temporal factors such as pickup hour, day of the week, and month. Peak hours (e.g., late afternoons)
										and weekdays (especially Thursdays and Fridays) show higher fares due to increased demand,
										while early mornings and non-peak hours offer the lowest fares. The passenger count has a
										moderate impact, with larger groups slightly increasing fares due to vehicle size requirements.</p>
						<p>Urban and high-demand areas exhibit higher fare variability, reflecting the influence of location.
										To secure the best rates, early morning trips and avoiding rush hours or weekends are
										recommended. These findings not only enhance fare predictability for users but also provide
										valuable insights for Uber’s pricing strategies and demand management.</p>
