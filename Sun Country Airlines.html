									<h1>Introduction</h1>
									<p>Founded in 1983, Sun Country Airlines started as a charter airline, providing Minnesotans with winter escapes to sunny destinations. Despite challenges like ownership changes and economic pressures, the airline found stability in 2011 under the Davis Family and has since focused on leisure travel to warm-weather destinations and U.S. military 
										charters. </p>
									<p>Recent efforts have concentrated on enhancing customer engagement, advancing digital marketing strategies, and leveraging data analytics to optimize the Ufly Rewards program, improve the online booking experience, and foster stronger customer relationships in a competitive market.</p>
									
									<h3>Current Challenges</h3>
									<p>The current state of customer insights and relationship management is marked by significant
										deficiencies. Decision-making is primarily driven by anecdotal evidence due to the absence of
										comprehensive customer data. The organization lacks dedicated data analysts, and the available
										data sources are limited in scope and depth. </p>
									<p>Although the website and backend systems have
										undergone partial upgrades, further improvements are necessary to fully meet customer expectations. Additionally, the Ufly Rewards loyalty program is underutilized, largely due to
										insufficient marketing efforts.</p>

									<h3>Strategic Objectives</h3>
									<P>To address these challenges, the organization aims to enhance its understanding of customer
										needs, behaviors, and preferences. Through data segmentation, the organization can develop more
										targeted and effective marketing strategies. Analyzing existing databases, such as the Ufly Rewards
										program and TSA flight records, will provide valuable insights and support more informed decision-
										making.</P>
									<p>Furthermore, building data analytics capabilities is essential for sustained growth and
										competitiveness. A key objective is to enhance the online booking channels and overall digital
										experience, aligning them with the evolving expectations of modern travelers. This improvement is
										crucial for increasing both customer attraction and retention. </p>
									<p>Another priority is to boost
										enrollment in the Ufly Rewards program by leveraging data-driven insights to optimize and
										promote the program more effectively. By harnessing improved customer insights, the organization
										can strengthen customer relationships, ensuring that the loyalty program becomes a central pillar
										in its strategy to foster long-term engagement and loyalty</p>

									<h1>Data in Statistical Analysis</h1>
									<h4>The data for this analysis is sourced from the TSA Claims Database, available on <a href="https://github.com/mengmengmeng020/mengmengmeng020.github.io/tree/main/Case%20Study%20of%20Sun%20Country%20Airlines">Terminal Security Agency Dataset</a>.</h4>
									<h3>Data Clustering and Data Filtering</h3>
									<p>To begin the analysis of our dataset, we are using the K-Means unsupervised method of clustering
										by selecting the clustering K using the elbow graph, focusing on the point where the error
										decreases sharply. The K value we considered optimal for this analysis is 5.</p>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-1.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>

									<p>While analyzing the flight tickets, we found that the round-trip tickets were being considered in
										two separate data entries. Since this could lead to misleading results by counting one person’s
										ticket twice during the analysis, we cleaned the data by removing only the departure tickets for
										round-trip journeys and keeping the rest unchanged. The following table shows an example of
										round-trip reservation.</p>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-2.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>

									<h3>Key Characteristics of Each Customer Segment</h3>
									<h4>Group 0: Hub Loyal Travelers</h4>
									<p>Purchase products departing from MSP, the airline hub, and purchase products offered on the
										airline website. This group does not have many that opt for memberships, but it is a group that
										has a high probability of becoming a member if we use the right strategies to pull them in.</p>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-3.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-4.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-5.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>


									<h4>Group 1: The Traveling Tribe</h4>
									<p>This group of travelers usually buy round-trip flight tickets and plans their journey ahead of time
										3
										by making reservations in advance. They also tend to use third-party booking websites to
										purchase cheaper airline tickets. This group mainly travels with three or more people and
										primarily consists of Gen Z and Millennial couples in their 20s and 30s and Baby Boomers over 55
										years of age.</p>
										<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-13.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
										<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-14.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
										<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-15.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
										<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-16.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
										<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-17.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>

									<h4>Group 2 - The Lone Voyagers</h4>
									<p>These are the solo travelers that prefer traveling alone. These free roamers usually tend to travel
										during the peak vacation seasons. There is a tendency for these travelers to purchase one-way airline tickets as they are more flexible and spontaneous with their plans and crave the excitement
										and thrill of the unknown. This group tends to be more budget conscious and usually pack light for
										better mobility during their travels.</p>
										<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-18.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
										<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-19.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
										<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-20.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>

									<h4>Group 3: Executive Frequent Flyers</h4>
									<p>This group includes flyers in their 30s to 60s, who have the highest loyalty membership status and
										travel a lot for the purpose of business. Most people in this group are business class travelers and
										many also upgrade to first class when they fly. This group tends to make reservations when
										needed rather than well in advance.</p>
											<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-21.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
											<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-22.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
											<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-23.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>

									<h4>Group 4: Escape Adventurers</h4>
									<P>Most travelers in this group are middle-aged between the ages of 35 and 54 and might be more
										established in their careers. This group's demographic tends to travel in pairs or groups such as
										married couples who have raised children or have more independent children. This group is ready
										to travel as they have disposable income and more time on their hands to do so. The top
										destinations for travel for this group are Las Vegas, Cancun, and Florida as per our analysis as
										these are places with retreats, lavish resorts, eye - catching attractions, and leisure activities for
										relaxation.</P>
										<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-24.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-25.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/stats-img-26.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
									
									<h3>Group Summary</h3>
									<h4>Group0 Hub-Loyal Travelers</h4>
									<p>This group frequently purchases products departing from the airline
										hub (MSP) and tends to buy from promotions on the airline’s website.
										While they are not yet members, they have high potential to join the
										membership program if incentivized with targeted promotions.</p>
									<h4>Group1 The Traveling Tribe</h4>
									<P>This group consists of families who primarily purchase round-trip tickets
										and plan their trips well in advance. They often use outside booking
										platforms to find cheaper fares. The group typically travels in parties of
										3 or more, and their demographic includes couples in their 20s and 30s
										with children, as well as grandparents over 55.</P>
									<h4>Group2 The Lone Voyagers</h4>
									<P>Solo travelers who tend to fly during vacation seasons (Q3/Q4), typically
										purchase one-way tickets instead of round-trip options. This group is
										driven by flexibility and spontaneity in their travel choices, often
										seeking out new adventures alone.</P>
									<h4>Group3 Executive Frequent Flyers</h4>
									<P>This group is heavily comprised of business travelers, aged 30-60, with a
										strong presence in the airline’s membership program. They frequently
										travel for work, often using first-class or upgrading to it, and tend to
										make last-minute bookings as needed for business purposes.</P>
									<h4>Group3 Escape Adventurers</h4>
									<P>This group consists mostly of 35-54-year-olds who prefer traveling with
										their partner or in small groups. Many are couples whose children are
										more independent, and they often travel to popular vacation
										destinations like Las Vegas, Cancun, and Florida.</P>

									<h1>Recommendations</h1>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/work-8.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
									<h3>Strategies for Hub-Loyal Travelers</h3>
									<p>Hub-Loyal Travelers customers frequently travel from a specific airport, often benefiting from the
										airline’s dominance at that location. A tailored loyalty program for this group can enhance their
										commitment by rewarding direct bookings and reinforcing purchasing habits through exclusive
										offers.</p>
									<p>Firstly, airlines can introduce a "Join and Earn" initiative, offering a membership sign-up
										bonus that includes extra miles or exclusive discounts for customers booking directly through the airline’s website. Additionally, airlines can further enrich this offer by providing exclusive benefits,
										such as access to special meals only available to members. This encourages long-term loyalty by
										creating a sense of exclusivity.</p>
									<p>Secondly, airlines can introduce "Hub-Exclusive Discounts," offering
										special fares for flights departing from key hub locations, such as Minneapolis-Saint Paul (MSP).
										This approach promotes loyalty to the specific hub by providing cost advantages to frequent
										travelers who consistently use the same airport. By aligning discounts with a traveler’s airport of
										preference, airlines can ensure that they remain competitive in retaining these high-value
										customers.</p>
									<p>Finally, promoting "Website Only Deals" reinforces direct booking behavior. By offering
										promotions and discounts exclusively through the airline’s website, customers are incentivized to
										consistently use the airline's digital platform, enhancing both loyalty and customer engagement.</p>
									<p>This strategy allows the airline to maintain better control over pricing while reducing dependency on third-party platforms.</p>

									<h3>Strategies for The Traveling Tribe</h3>
									<p>The Traveling Tribe consists of families and groups who prioritize value and convenience. Airlines
										targeting this demographic can enhance their appeal by offering bundled packages and early
										booking incentives that address the unique needs of family travelers.</p>
									<p>A key offering for this
											segment is the "Family Bundle Discount," which provides savings for bookings of three or more
											passengers. In addition to the monetary discount, airlines can enhance the appeal by including
											value-added services such as free checked baggage or family seating arrangements. These benefits
											directly address the needs of families who seek comfort and convenience, thus promoting loyalty
											through enhanced travel experiences.</p>
									<p> Furthermore, the "Early Bird Family Saver" offering special
											pricing or added benefits—such as free seat selection or higher mileage accumulation—when
											tickets are booked at least three months before departure, airlines can secure bookings earlier in
											the travel cycle. This not only helps families plan their trips in advance but also provides the airline
											with a more predictable booking pipeline, enhancing overall revenue management.</p>
									<p>Additionally,
											airlines can introduce "Child-Friendly Packages," includes complimentary child meals and in-flight
											entertainment, ensuring that the travel experience is enjoyable for younger passengers. By
											addressing the specific needs of family travelers, airlines can build a reputation as a family-friendly
											option, further driving loyalty in this segment.</p>

									<h3>Strategies for The Lone Voyagers</h3>
									<P>Solo travelers, often seeking independence and adventure, represent another key segment for
										airlines. For this group, airlines can focus on offering promotions that appeal to the unique preferences and behaviors of individual travelers. The "Solo Adventure Package" provides a
										tailored bundle for solo travelers, offering discounted seat selection and free baggage. This
										package addresses the specific needs of solo voyagers by reducing costs and enhancing the travel
										experience, thus positioning the airline as a preferred choice for independent travelers. </P>
									<p>In
										addition, airlines can release "Q3/Q4 Special Offers" targeting solo travelers during peak vacation
										periods. These seasonal promotions, which coincide with the busiest travel times in the third and
										fourth quarters, provide solo travelers with the opportunity to enjoy discounted fares and special
										benefits. Such timely offers capitalize on the increased demand during holiday and vacation
										seasons, encouraging solo travelers to choose the airline for their personal travel plans. </p>
									<p>Though
										typically associated with families, "Child-Friendly Packages" can also benefit solo travelers who
										may be responsible for traveling with children. By offering child-friendly amenities such as in-flight
										entertainment and tailored meals, airlines can further enhance the customer experience for all
										travelers, improving overall satisfaction and promoting repeat business.</p>

									<h3>Strategies for the Executive Frequent Flyers</h3>
									<P>By offering customized corporate packages, exclusive perks, and loyalty-driven incentives, airlines
										can significantly enhance the overall travel experience for these distinct groups of passengers. One
										effective strategy for attracting and retaining Executive Frequent Flyers is the introduction of
										corporate discount packages.</P>
									<P>Businesses that frequently book flights for their employees can
										benefit from bulk booking discounts, thereby reducing overall travel expenses. These corporate
										rates can be designed to offer incremental benefits based on the volume of flights booked by the
										company. As businesses increase their booking frequency, they would unlock greater discounts and
										additional perks, creating a compelling financial incentive for continued engagement with the
										airline. </P>
									<P>Moreover, offering customized in-flight meal plans exclusive to corporate clients enhances
										the personalized nature of the travel experience. By aligning such offerings with the needs and
										preferences of corporate travelers, airlines can foster a sense of exclusivity and convenience,
										further solidifying their relationship with this customer segment. </P>
									<P>Another important aspect of
										enhancing the travel experience includes access to dedicated concierge services and expedited
										security checks. Airlines can significantly reduce the time executives spend navigating the airport
										by offering seamless access to TSA Precheck, reducing the overall burden of travel for this high-
										value customer base. </P>
									<p>Additionally, lounge access with amenities tailored to the needs of business
										travelers, such as meeting rooms and fast Wi-Fi, can enhance productivity and relaxation during
										layovers, thereby elevating their overall experience.</p>

									<h3>Strategies for the Escape Adventurers</h3>
									<P>Escape Adventurers, a customer segment focused on leisure and vacation travel, can be
										incentivized through specialized travel packages. Aim at couples seeking popular vacation
										destinations. By partnering with hotels and resorts in destinations such as Las Vegas, Cancun, and
										Florida, airlines can create comprehensive all-inclusive packages that cater to couples. These
										packages can include discounted flights, hotel stays, and additional perks such as spa services,
										ensuring a seamless and luxurious vacation experience for couples. </P>
									<p>Additionally, providing these
										customers with attractive airfare discounts, such as "Buy One, Get One Half Price with double
										points" promotions, can incentivize them to travel more frequently. These incentives would not
										only appeal to the sense of value sought by leisure travelers but would also drive long-term loyalty
										to the airline.</p>

									<h3>Loyalty Status Upgrades for Escape Adventurers</h3>
									<P>Loyalty programs play a significant role in increasing customer retention, particularly among
										Escape Adventurers. Offering loyalty status upgrades based on the number of flights taken within a
										year can serve as a powerful incentive for increasing travel frequency. </P>
									<p>Travelers who achieve higher
										loyalty statuses would gain access to exclusive offers and perks, such as complimentary upgrades
										or priority boarding, further enhancing their travel experience. </p>
									<p>Such programs encourage travelers
										to book more flights, creating a cycle of loyalty and reward that benefits both the customer and
										the airline.</p>

									<h1>Conclusion</h1>
									<p>By analyzing the distinct behaviors and preferences of Sun Country Airlines' customer segments,
										targeted promotions can significantly enhance customer loyalty and drive increased bookings.
										</p>
									<p>Implementing membership incentives, tailored discounts, and value-added services, such as family
										packages and corporate deals, aligns with the needs of each group. By focusing on personalized

									<p>These strategies, alongside seasonal and
										family-oriented promotions, will help Sun Country Airlines remain competitive, improve customer
